## by Chukwunonso Emmanuel Chukwumaeze

## Objectives

This is a repository for Udacity Data Analyst Project 2 (Data Wrangling). The dataset used in the project is also included in this repository.

## Introduction

I gathered data using three different methods in this project;
1. Using pandas read_csv
2. Using Requests library to gather image predictions data
3. Tweepy library to gather additional data via Twitter API
The three datasets were assessed and cleaned individually, then later merged as one.

## Project Methodology

The main steps for this project can be summarized as follows:

- Data Wrangling
  - Data Gathering
  - Data Assessment
  - Data Cleaning
- Analysis/Visualization
